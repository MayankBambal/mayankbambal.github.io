# SQL Cheat Sheet - Quick Reference Guide

## About This Cheat Sheet

This cheat sheet provides a quick reference for SQL fundamentals, organized by the logical execution order of SQL queries. Each module focuses on a specific SQL clause or concept, providing essential syntax, rules, and tips.

## SQL Query Execution Order

**The most important concept in SQL** - Understanding this order explains alias scope, WHERE vs. HAVING usage, and overall query behavior:

1. **`FROM`** and **`JOIN`** - Define source tables and relationships
2. **`WHERE`** - Filter individual rows
3. **`GROUP BY`** - Group rows for aggregation
4. **`HAVING`** - Filter groups
5. **`SELECT`** - Choose columns and create expressions
6. **`DISTINCT`** - Remove duplicate rows
7. **`ORDER BY`** - Sort the results
8. **`LIMIT`** / **`OFFSET`** - Limit the number of rows returned

> **ðŸ’¡ Key Point**: This execution order is logical, not necessarily the physical order. Understanding it helps you write correct, efficient SQL.

## How to Use This Cheat Sheet

Each module covers one major SQL component:

- **Module 1**: FROM Clause and JOINs
- **Module 2**: WHERE Clause and Filtering  
- **Module 3**: GROUP BY and Aggregate Functions
- **Module 4**: HAVING Clause
- **Module 5**: SELECT Clause and Expressions
- **Module 6**: ORDER BY Clause
- **Module 7**: LIMIT and Result Set Control

## Quick Syntax Reference

```sql
-- Complete query structure
SELECT [DISTINCT] column_list
FROM table_name [alias]
[JOIN other_table ON condition]
[WHERE condition]
[GROUP BY column_list]
[HAVING condition]
[ORDER BY column_list [ASC|DESC]]
[LIMIT number [OFFSET number]]
```

## Key SQL Principles

1. **No guaranteed order without ORDER BY** - Results are arbitrary without explicit sorting
2. **NULL requires special handling** - Use `IS NULL`/`IS NOT NULL`, not `= NULL`
3. **Performance matters** - Write sargable conditions, index join columns
4. **DBMS variations exist** - Test syntax on your target database system
5. **Aliases have scope** - Can't use SELECT aliases in WHERE/GROUP BY/HAVING
